Welcome to the Sensepi Template
==============================

This site is designed to read in Data from Thingspeak public channel which is reading in sensor Data from a Raspberry pi for the indoor readings. 
There is one Air temparature reading which is used for the out door temperature which was a public channel that I am not providing the readings for the purpose of the Application its useful to have.
A tweet is also sent when the temperature goes above 25 degrees so that you dont leave the Heating on too long and run up your bill trying to dy your clothes indoors!
